    1. Clone the repo: git clone https://github.com/leagerl1/HackBUPortal.git
    2. Install project dependencies: Inside the hackbu_portal directory run the command <tt>bundle install</tt>
    3. Migrate the database with the command rake db:migrate
    4. To run the app run the command <tt>rails s</tt> (for local dev) or <tt>rails s -p $PORT -b $IP</tt> (for c9 dev)
    5. To run tests run the commands <tt>rake spec</tt> for rsepc or <tt>rake cucumber</tt> for cucumber
